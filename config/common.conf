# This directive specifies a list of algorithms to be used when creating a digest file
# containing the hash output from any of the supported options below. Adding them may
# take a long time. Supported hashes: adler32, crc32, crc32b, gost, haval128, haval160,
# haval192, haval224, haval256, md2, md4, md5, ripemd128, ripemd256, ripemd320, sha1,

# Using this, the default tarball and image date format can be changed according to the
# requirement. This customizable format may be needed when you want to set different
# timestamp in output files. This option can be overridden by using -D option.
TARBALLDATE="%Y%m"

# This option specifies a compression algorithm that will be used to produce any tarball
# images, including stages as well as Portage snapshots. Actually supported: bz2, gz, xz.
TARBALLFORMAT="xz"

# A time designation representing the time in seconds that you allow the connection to
# the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, once it has connected this
# option is of no more use. Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether. Unless you
# know what you are doing, it is best not to change the default timeout settings.
FETCHTIMEOUT="180"

# Sets the number of times EzBuild will attempt to download files and retrieve portage
# and overlays before it exits with an error. This allows for a more successful retrieval
# without user intervention most times.
FETCHTRIES="3"

# Specifies the maximum number of jobs (commands) to spawn simultaneously. See also the
# related LOADAVERAGE option.
MAXJOBS="4"

# Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are other jobs running
# and the load average is at least set LOAD (a floating-point number). This option is
# recommended for use in combi‚Äênation with MAXJOBS in order to avoid excess load.

STOREDIR="/var/tmp/ezbuild"

# Treats all errors as fatal, when enabled. Disabling this option allows EzBuild scripts
# to continue execution when some non-fatal errors occure. They all will be treated as

FATALERRORS="yes"

# When enabled, causes EzBuild to save every information about progress and all executed

# stored in the log file.
LOGDATEFORMAT="%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"

# Specifies an e-mail address, where all notifications will be sent to. If this variable
